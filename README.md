# Pokedex-KMP

A sample app featuring Compose Multiplatform and PokeApi. This app was created for the sole purpose for me to check out Compose Multiplatform in a multiplatform app and some new libraries supporting it. 
The client apps have two different screens, one for viewing the full list of Pokemon with Pagination and one for viewing Pokemon details.

The shared Kotlin code features the levels from Datasources to UI and follows the Clean Architecture Guidelines.

## Libraries Used

- Ktor for Networking
- Koin for Dependency Injection
- Compose Multiplatform for UI
- Voyager for Navigation
